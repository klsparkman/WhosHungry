# WhosHungry

Have you ever wanted to go out to eat with friends or family, and nobody can decide on where to go? 

This is why I created Who's Hungry.  

As the user, the first thing you need to do is sign up in the app.  After signing up, you will need to decide whether you want to create a game for your family and friends, or input an invite code that someone has sent to you.  If you decide to create a game you will need to pick a city that your group will be meeting in to eat, how big of a radius you want to drive within that city and lastly you will need to decide on what type of meal you want to eat (breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert).  After you have completed that, you will wait for everyone to join your game! Once everyone's names are on the screen indicating that they have joined, then you can begin!

The app will pull up 20 of the top rated restaurants in the area you have selected and display each restaurant one at a time.  If it is somewhere you would like to eat, you will swipe the card to the right.  If you don't want to eat there, you will swipe left.  Once all players have completed their swiping, a results page will show how everyone voted.  After a decision has been made, you can simply tap on a restaurant and the app will give you directions to the winning restaurant!
