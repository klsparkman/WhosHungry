# WhosHungry

Who's Hungry is a fun and FREE decision making app to help you find top rated restaurants in your area via Yelp!


Have you ever been with friends and family, and decided you all wanted to get something to eat but couldn't agree on one restaurant? Have you been on vacation and wondered what kind of food looks good in the area? Or have you wanted to enjoy some alone time and treat yourself to a new food experience? Well now there is a solution for you, Who's Hungry!


How it works:


First, decide whether you want to create a game or join an existing one that someone else created.


To create a game: as the game creator you need to pick a city that you want to eat in, a radius of how far you would like to travel in that city as well as what type of meal you would like to eat (e.g. breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert). After you have created your game, an invite code will be saved to your device and you can text that to whoever you would like to join.


To join a game: paste the invite code that the game creator texted you into the app and wait for the rest of the group to join!


Once all of the players have joined, their names will be displayed on a waiting screen and the game creator will be the one to start the game!


How the swiping works: 20 top rated restaurants will be displayed one at a time on your device. Swipe left on the restaurant if you don't want to eat there, and swipe right if you do.


After you have finished swiping, you will then wait on the results page until everyone has finished swiping. Based on majority votes the winner will be displayed! If there is no majority winner, you will be prompted to revote if necessary.


Who's Hungry has been a labor of love, and my hope is that it helps you discover new and exciting food experiences with the ones you love. Enjoy and happy swiping!
